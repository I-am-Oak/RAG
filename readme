Process Overview

Stage 1:
Knowledge management. :loads pdfs from the source directory, processes the documents: text splitting and chunking
Stage 2:
Vector store: receives chunks of texts and meta data as input. Converts them to vector embeddings and stores them on MongoDB Atlas
Stage 3:
Query Retrival: Receives the query from the user. Converts it to vector embedding, makes vector search in the db - dense retrieves documents and returns them as prompt.
Stage 4:
LLM Response Generation: Opensource LLM model is loaded. The retrieved document and the query is sent to the model for output generation.
